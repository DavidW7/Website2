		<h1>Sequoia Resources Corp.</h1>
		<p>Registered Oil and Gas Company in Calgary, Alberta</p>

		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<p>We are a private, debt-free Canadian entity with conventional producing oil and gas assets predominately in Alberta. Through Sequoia Resources Corp and Sequoia Operating Corp, we operate over 9000boepd of low-decline production as well as associated midstream infrastructure. Through over 2 million net acres of crown and freehold mineral rights, the company is well positioned to benefit from an upswing of commodity cycle.</p>

		<h1>Operations</h1>
		<p>W4 Shallow Gas <br /> We operated extensive shallow gas production in W4 Alberta where transportation is unconstrained. Through ownership of 14 gas plants and extensive network of pipelines and efficient field operation, we keep our production cost low and are uniquely positioned to benefit from an uplift in gas prices. </p>

		<p>The production are mostly Cretaceous and Devonian sweet shallow gas with less than 800m in depth and multiple stacked zone and play types. The base decline is between 10-15% and we enjoy  a low base royalty rate of ~5%  at <$5/mcf gas price. </p>

		<p>Our Viking/Colorado shallow shale gas play has >150TCF of gas in place with horizontal drilling largest derisked by neighboring competitors. We estimate over 2000+ drilling locations ready for execution with higher gas prices.</p>

		<p>Ferrybank/Chigwell Light Oil pool</p>

		<p>We are a dominant operator in the Ferrybank/Chigwell oil pools. Through waterflood and CO2 flood, we are constantly optimizing the play for higher oil recoveries.</p>

		<h1>Safety and Environmental Compliances</h1>
		<p> Operational safety is in our genes. Even though the operational risk of the assets we operate are fairly low (sweet, shallow gas away from urban settlements), we take a proactive approach to ensure risks are minimized and addressed with immediate attention.</p>
		<p>We are working closely with AER to ensure we stay ahead in abandonment and reclamation of wells and facilities. </p>
